### <a name="week7.2"></a>Week 7.2 (10/14) - Sound / Text Project Discussion

- Discuss Project 3 - Sound / Text


- **Sound / Text Project (due 11/18)**
  - **Create** sound / music, or text using a machine learning algorithm
  - **Put** your project URL and documentation URL into the [Projects Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_eyQ4XfzGKpqMIW7FatoDbHBJSAqyPfrkKcyCI66gbI/edit?usp=sharing)
  - You can incorporate the sound / text output into a larger work, e.g. your earlier visual project, website, printed image, interactive
    program or use the output of the machine learning algorithm as source material for
    your creative process (e.g. generate sound / text and then further manipulate them)
  - The idea is to see how you can use the tools we've looked at in class (or any tool you can find)
    to express your creativity or make a comment on machine learning / AI
  - The work or documentation of it should be accessible on the web (e.g. for a printed work post photos)

  - Required documentation (include on project site or separate page):
    - Name of your project
    - What inspired you to make this work?
    - How does the content of your work related to some of the concepts we've covered in class?
    - What tools did you use? How did the tools affect your creative process? (If you found the
      tools limiting you can also comment on that.)
