## Workshop description

'Letters through the Latent Space' is an interactive workshop where participants co-create a realtime AI system that enhances written letters with diverse visual styles. As participants write, their handwritten letters are passed through an AI model that generates augmentations such as transforming the writing into graffiti or watercolors. The themes of the workshop include creative and critical use of AI, use of AI in real-time interactive systems, hands-on collaborative learning, and inclusive access to technology through the use of open and free tools. Participants will not just use the system but participate in collectively modifying it through prompt engineering and tweaking the machine learning model parameters as the system runs.
