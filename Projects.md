# Projects

## Project 1: Speculative Design (due Tuesday 2/13)
- **Create** an "artifact" of speculative design that shows a potential application of AI. It could be a product mockup, video, news report, product marketing, etc.
  - Add a link to the documentation of your project in the [Projects Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_eyQ4XfzGKpqMIW7FatoDbHBJSAqyPfrkKcyCI66gbI/edit?usp=sharing)
- **Write** 5-6 paragraphs (approximately a page) of documentation describing your project and your process
  - Add a link to your documentation in the [Projects Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_eyQ4XfzGKpqMIW7FatoDbHBJSAqyPfrkKcyCI66gbI/edit?usp=sharing)
- **Prepare** a 5-10 minute presentation to explain your idea. You will give your presentation in class. Be ready to receive feedback on your project and give feedback to the other groups.
- Required documentation (include on separate page and include link in Projects Spreadsheet):
  - Name of your project
  - What concepts are you examining in your work? What response are you hoping to provoke in the audience? 
  - What inspired you to make this work?
  - How does the content of your work relate to some of the concepts we've covered in class?
  - What tools did you use? How did the tools affect your creative process? (If you found the
    tools limiting you can also comment on that.)
    - For text to image and related techniques, include the prompts that you used
  - Documentation of the contribution of each group member (each group member writes one paragraph explaining what they did)
 
### Grading Rubric

Production assignments are graded on the overall quality of work, comprehension of topic, how well project is functioning, and individual capacity/ability improvement (are you getting better compared to yourself). Documentation is graded on quality & extent of documentation.

## Project 2: Visual (due Tuesday 3/5)
- **Create** an *artwork* that is an image, series of images or video using Stable Diffusion (e.g. Easy Diffusion, ComfyUI)
  - You can additionally use other tools but you must use Easy Diffusion or ComfyUI as part of your project
- **Put** your project URL into the [Projects Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_eyQ4XfzGKpqMIW7FatoDbHBJSAqyPfrkKcyCI66gbI/edit?usp=sharing)
- You can incorporate the visual output into a larger work, e.g. website, printed image, interactive
  program or use the output of the machine learning algorithm as source material for
  your creative process (e.g. generate images and then further manipulate them)
- The work must make a creative or critical statement (it must do more than just use AI tools, it has to make a statement or provoke some questions)
- Some ideas:
  - create a series of related images using style transfer and present them on a website
  - generate the description of an using GPT-2 and then draw it yourself
  - create an animation through the latent space of StyleGAN
  - cartoonize some images to create a comic strip (online or printed)
  - generate an image using machine learning and redraw it yourself
- The work should somehow address one of the concepts weâ€™ve covered in class (e.g. extending creativity, who is the author?, real/fake, AI revolution, bias, etc)
- The idea is to see how you can use the tools we've looked at in class (or any tool you can find)
  to express your creativity or make a comment on machine learning / AI
- The work or documentation of it should be accessible on the web (e.g. for a printed work post photos)

- Required documentation (include on project site or separate page):
  - Name of your project
  - What concepts are you examining in your work? What response are you hoping to provoke in the audience? 
  - What inspired you to make this work?
  - How does the content of your work relate to some of the concepts we've covered in class?
  - What tools did you use? How did the tools affect your creative process? (If you found the
    tools limiting you can also comment on that.)
    - For text to image and related techniques, include the prompts that you used
  - Documentation of the contribution of each group member (each group member writes one paragraph explaining what they did)

## Project 3: Sound / Text (due Tuesday 4/2)
- **Create** sound / music, or text using a machine learning algorithm
- **Put** your project URL and documentation URL into the [Projects Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_eyQ4XfzGKpqMIW7FatoDbHBJSAqyPfrkKcyCI66gbI/edit?usp=sharing)
- You can incorporate the sound / text output into a larger work, e.g. your earlier visual project, website, printed image, interactive
  program or use the output of the machine learning algorithm as source material for
  your creative process (e.g. generate sound / text and then further manipulate them)
- The idea is to see how you can use the tools we've looked at in class (or any tool you can find)
  to express your creativity or make a comment on machine learning / AI
- The work or documentation of it should be accessible on the web (e.g. for a printed work post photos)

  - What inspired you to make this work?
  - How does the content of your work related to some of the concepts we've covered in class?
  - What tools did you use? How did the tools affect your creative process? (If you found the
    tools limiting you can also comment on that.)
  - Documentation of the contribution of each group member (each group member writes one paragraph explaining what they did)
    
- In-class presentation
  - 5-7 minute presentation of your project
  - Cover the most important concepts and results
  - 10 minutes of response / questions
  - Additional time is available for performances (contact Mang in advance)

## Final Project (due Tuesday 5/7)
For the final your are free to choose what you'd like to do. The project should be a creative use of machine learning. It should be more ambitious in scope compared to what we've done so far this semester. You could do any number of things. A few sample ideas are:

- Build upon and fully complete one of your projects from earlier in the semester
- Create an interactive classification app or game (example)
- Create a physical comic book using style transfer
- Create an interactive dance performance
- Generate a musical composition or an EP of songs
- Create a music/sound generation tool
- Create a twitter bot (a variation could be a bot that learns and grows from people's responses)
- Create an interactive application (tool/game/art piece) that uses text generation
- Create an art piece that illustrates/amplifies characteristics of this technology (could be illuminating or comedic or both)
The list could go on and on. The above should be considered far from exhaustive.

You may work within a group or by yourself.

### Grading Rubric
- 10pts Creative Thinking: The project should not be just reproducing things using the tools we've looked at. It should have some novel implementation or approach in the application of the tech. Depending on the project, this could include indication of development of personal style/taste (if art project for example), and/or imaginative implementations of the tech in exploring ideas.

- 10pts Production Quality: The project needs to be well polished, with considerable work put into the finished work.

- 10pts Clear Conceptual Underpinning: The project needs to be well thought out, and have a clear concept that you are working with from start to finish. The documentation should clearly show the concepts you are engaging with.

- 10pts Machine Learning Application: The project should use and benefit from machine learning.
- 10pts Documentation
- Total / 50pts

### Documentation
- Required documentation (include on project site or separate page):
  - Name of your project
  - What inspired you to make this work?
  - How does the content of your work related to some of the concepts we've covered in class?
  - What tools did you use? How did the tools affect your creative process? (If you found the tools limiting you can also comment on that.)
